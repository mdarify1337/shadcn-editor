description: Lexical base rich text editor using shadcn/ui components.
---

This rich text editor is built on top of [Lexical](https://lexical.dev/) and uses [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components. Most of the code is based on the [Lexical Playground](https://playground.lexical.dev/) example.

It's super easy to get started with Lexical in any environment. Lexical is framework agnostic, but provides a set of bindings for React to help you get off the ground even quicker. After the initial setup, delightfully ergonomic APIs make building custom functionality straightforward and downright fun!

_Lexical is an extensible text editor framework that does things differently._

## FAQ

		Why copy/paste and not packaged as a dependency?
	</AccordionTrigger>
	<AccordionContent>
The idea behind this is to give you ownership and control over the code, allowing you to decide how the components are built and styled.

Start with some sensible defaults, then customize the components to your needs.

One of the drawbacks of packaging the components in an npm package is that the style is coupled with the implementation. _The design of your components should be separate from their implementation._
